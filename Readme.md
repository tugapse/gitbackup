# **Git Automation Script**

This script provides a simple yet powerful way to automate common Git operations like pulling updates, running pre-commit commands, staging, committing, and pushing changes. It's designed to be highly configurable for different projects and offers precise control over its execution and logging.

## **🚀 Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Before you dive in, make sure you have:

* **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
* **Git** installed and configured (ensure the git command is accessible in your system's PATH).
* A **local Git repository** (or a path where one can be initialized) ready for automation.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone this repository** (or simply copy the files) to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tugapse/gitbackup.git 
   cd gitbackup
   ```
   Verify your file structure:
   ```
   your_project/
   ├── main.py
   ├── config.json  # Example config, or custom names
   └── core/
       ├── __init__.py
       ├── cli_parser.py
       ├── command_logic.py
       ├── git_logic.py
       ├── logger.py
       ├── config_operations.py # For config creation/management
       └── workflow_logic.py    # For the main workflow
   ```

2. **Set up a Python Virtual Environment** (highly recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   # On Windows: .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat
   # On Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller # PyInstaller is needed if you plan to build executables
   ```

## ⚙️ Workflow Explained

The script executes a well-defined, sequential workflow for each task:

1.  **Repository Setup (if needed)**:

    *   If `--initialize` is used and the `git_repo_path` doesn't exist or isn't a Git repo, it will be initialized (git init) and the origin remote will be added.
    *   The script will then ensure the specified `--branch` is checked out, creating it locally if it doesn't exist and attempting to push it to the remote to set up tracking.
2.  **Initial Git Pull**: Starts by performing a git pull on your specified branch to ensure your local repository is completely up-to-date.
3.  **Execute Pre-commit Command**: Runs the shell command defined in your `command_line` configuration. This is where you'd typically integrate build scripts, tests, data generation, or any other necessary pre-commit steps.
4.  **Check for Changes**: Scans your Git repository for any modifications, new files, or deletions using `git status --porcelain`.
5.  **Git Add & Commit**: If the script detects any changes in Step 4, it stages all modified and untracked files (`git add .`) and then creates a new commit using the `git_commit_message` from your configuration. A timestamp `[MMDDHHMMSS]` will be automatically appended to the commit message.
6.  **Git Push**: If a new commit was successfully created in Step 5, the script pushes your local commits to the remote repository.
7.  **Final Git Pull**: Performs one last git pull after the push. This ensures your local repository is fully synchronized with the remote, accounting for any potential concurrent changes or merge resolutions.

## **🛠️ Configuration**

The script uses straightforward JSON files to define each automated task. By default, these configuration files are stored in a dedicated folder within your user's home directory: `~/git_automation_configs/`.

### **Creating a New Configuration File (--create)**

You can generate a new configuration file with default settings directly from your terminal.
```bash
python main.py --create "My First Git Task"
```
Or:
```bash
python main.py --create "My Custom Task" -o my_custom_task.json
```

* `--create "TASK_NAME"`: Initiates the creation of a new config file, using `TASK_NAME` as its identifier.
* `-o FILEPATH`: (Optional) Specifies the output filename for your config. If omitted, the file will be named `task_name.json` (e.g., `my_first_git_task.json`) and placed in the default `~/git_automation_configs/` directory.

After creation, a file like `my_first_git_task.json` will appear. You'll need to **edit it** to fit your project:

```json
{
  "name": "My First Git Task",
  "origin": "origin",
  "branch": "main",
  "git_repo_path": "/path/to/your/local_git_repo", // <-- IMPORTANT: Update this path!
  "command_line": "echo 'Your command here (e.g., npm run build, python script.py)'", // <-- Update this command!
  "git_commit_message": "Automated update for My First Git Task"
}
```

#### **Overwriting Existing Configs**

By default, the script prevents overwriting an existing configuration file. To force an overwrite, use the `--overwrite` flag:
```bash
python main.py --create "My Config" -o my_config.json --overwrite
```

#### **Pre-populating Fields During Creation**

You can also pre-populate fields like branch, origin, and git_repo_path when creating the file:
```bash
python main.py --create "Dev Branch Workflow" -o dev_workflow.json --branch develop --origin my-fork --folder "/home/user/my_dev_project" --verbose
```

This command creates `dev_workflow.json` with `develop` as the branch, `my-fork` as the origin, and `"/home/user/my_dev_project"` as the repository path. It also enables verbose output during the creation process itself.

### **Editing Your Configuration (--edit)**

To quickly open an existing configuration file in your system's default text editor:
```bash
python main.py my_daily_backup --edit
```
Or:
```bash
python main.py --json /path/to/my_custom_config.json --edit
```

### **Listing All Configured Tasks (--list)**

To see a summary of all configuration files found in your default config directory (`~/git_automation_configs/`):
```bash
python main.py --list
```

**Example Output:**
```
Listing all configured tasks in '/home/user/git_automation_configs':
- My First Git Task - main
  /path/to/your/local_git_repo
- Dev Branch Workflow - develop
  /home/user/my_dev_project
```

### **Key Configuration Fields** 

Open your generated JSON file (e.g., `my_first_git_task.json`) and carefully **modify these key fields**:

* `name`: A clear, descriptive name for your automation task.
* `origin`: The name of your Git remote (e.g., `origin`, `upstream`). Defaults to `origin`.
* `branch`: The specific Git branch you want the script to operate on (e.g., `main`, `develop`, `feature/new-feature`). Defaults to `main`.
* `git_repo_path`: **REQUIRED!** The **absolute path** to your local Git repository. This is vital for the script to locate and manage your code.
* `command_line`: The shell command to execute *before* the Git operations. This is perfect for running build scripts, tests, data generation, or any other pre-commit steps. Leave it empty (`""`) if no command is needed.
* `git_commit_message`: The default commit message to use for automated commits. A timestamp `[MMDDHHMMSS]` will be automatically appended to this message during the commit.

## **🚀 Usage**

To run your automated task, simply specify the task name (if in the default config directory) or the full path to its configuration file:
```bash
python main.py my_daily_backup
```
Or:
```bash
python main.py --json /path/to/my_custom_config.json
```

### **Command-line Overrides**

You can temporarily override configuration values for a single run directly from the command line without modifying your JSON file. This is great for flexible execution.

* **Override Branch**:
  ```bash
  python main.py my_task.json --branch feature/experimental
  ```
* **Override Origin**:
  ```bash
  python main.py my_task.json --origin specific-remote
  ```
* **Override Repository Folder**:
  ```bash
  python main.py my_task.json --folder "/another/path/to/your/repo"
  ```
* **Combine Multiple Overrides**:
  ```bash
  python main.py my_task.json --branch hotfix/bug-fix --origin fork-origin --folder "/tmp/my_cloned_repo"
  ```

### **Initializing a Git Repository (--initialize)**

If the `git_repo_path` specified in your config (or via `--folder`) does not contain an initialized Git repository, you can tell the script to initialize it automatically:
```bash
python main.py my_new_repo_task --folder /tmp/my_new_repo --initialize --branch dev --origin https://github.com/user/new-repo.git
```
If `--initialize` is used and the repository already exists, the script will simply proceed without re-initializing it.

## **📝 Logging and Verbosity**

The script provides clear, color-coded output to suit your needs:

* **Default Output**: By default, the script provides a concise overview, showing major process steps (in **cyan**), successful completions (in **green**), and critical errors (in **red**). Informational messages (like listing tasks) are always visible.
  ```bash
  python main.py my_task.json
  ```

  **Example Output (Default):**
  ```
  Starting automated task from '/home/user/git_automation_configs/my_task.json'

  Task Details: My First Git Task
    Git Repo Path: '/home/user/Code/my-repo' (from config)
    Branch: 'main' (from config/default)
    Origin: 'origin' (from config/default)
    Command Line: 'echo "hello"'
    Git Commit Message: 'Automated update for My First Git Task'

  ```

* **Verbose Mode (--verbose)**: For detailed diagnostics or to see every operation in action, use the `--verbose` flag. This will display all internal logs, including Git command outputs (STDOUT/STDERR) and extensive progress messages.
  ```bash
  python main.py my_task.json --verbose
  ```

## **📦 Building Standalone Executables**

You can package your Python script into a standalone executable for easier distribution using **PyInstaller**.

1. **Ensure PyInstaller is installed** in your virtual environment: `pip install pyinstaller`
2. **Use the provided build scripts**:
   * **For Linux/macOS**: `./build.sh`
   * **For Windows**: `build.cmd`
**Important Note on Cross-Compilation**: PyInstaller is not a cross-compiler. To create a Windows executable (.exe), you must run the build process on a Windows machine. Similarly, to create a Linux executable, build it on a Linux machine. Using virtual machines is a common way to achieve builds for different operating systems from a single host.

## **🐛 Troubleshooting**

* **Error: 'git' command not found**: This usually means Git isn't installed on your system, or its executable isn't added to your system's PATH.
* **Error: ... 'git_repo_path' is missing**: Verify that the `git_repo_path` field is correctly set in your JSON configuration file, or that you've provided it via the `--folder` command-line argument.
* **Error: ... not a valid Git repository**: The path you've provided for `git_repo_path` (or `--folder`) either doesn't exist or isn't a recognized Git repository. Use `--initialize` if you want the script to set it up for you.
* **Error: Default editor command not found**: When using `--edit`, your system needs to have a default program associated with opening `.json` files, and that program's command needs to be in your system's PATH. For Linux, ensure `xdg-open` is available.
